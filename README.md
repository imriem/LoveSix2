# Love Six

The number 6 is a truly great number. Given two int values, `a` and `b`, print `True` if either one is 6, or if their sum or their difference is 6. 

Note: the function `abs(num)` computes the absolute value of a number.

Your program needs to take 2 numbers, `a` and `b`, from the user. Then print `True` or `False` depending on the numbers given by the user.


|a|b|Output value|
|:-----:|:-----:|:----:|
|6|4|True|
|4|5|False|
|1|5|True|

## Sample 1
	Enter the first number: 6
	Enter the second number: 4
	True

## Sample 2
	Enter the first number: 4
	Enter the second number: 5
	False
